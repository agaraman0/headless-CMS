Implementing a headless CMS architecture that takes care of 
dynamic page content, images, and incorporates a CDN based 
architecture involves a series of steps. Here's an overview 
of the steps involved:

1. Select a Headless CMS Platform: Choose a headless CMS 
platform that fits your project's needs and requirements. 
Some popular options include Contentful, Strapi, and Sanity.

2. Design the Content Model: Design the content model for your 
website, which involves defining the content types, fields, 
and relationships. This will enable you to create and manage 
content effectively.

3. Develop the Backend: Build the backend of your headless CMS 
using the chosen CMS platform. This involves setting up the 
content types and fields, defining the content relationships, 
and creating the APIs to communicate with the frontend.

4. Develop the Frontend: Build the frontend of your website 
using a frontend framework or library of your choice. Use the 
APIs provided by the headless CMS to fetch content from the 
backend.

5. Implement CDN Architecture: Use a CDN service provider like 
Cloudflare, Akamai, or Amazon CloudFront to implement CDN 
architecture. The CDN will store and deliver content, such as 
images and videos, to users from a server closest to their 
location, reducing latency and improving load times.

6. Use Dynamic Image Optimization: Use dynamic image 
optimization techniques to optimize images on-the-fly and 
reduce their file size. This will help to improve the loading 
times of your website's pages.

7. Implement Caching: Implement caching to store frequently 
accessed content, such as images and videos, on the CDN 
servers. This will reduce the time required to retrieve 
content from the backend and improve the website's 
performance.

8. Test and Optimize: Finally, test your website to ensure that 
it's functioning as expected. Optimize the website by making 
tweaks and adjustments to improve its performance, load 
times, and user experience.

In conclusion, implementing a headless CMS architecture that 
takes care of dynamic page content and images, and 
incorporates a CDN based architecture involves selecting a 
CMS platform, designing the content model, developing the 
backend and frontend, implementing CDN architecture, using 
dynamic image optimization, implementing caching, testing, 
and optimizing.
